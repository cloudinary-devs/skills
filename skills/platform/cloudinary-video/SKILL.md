# Cloudinary Video

Covers what the `cloudinary-transformations` and `cloudinary-docs` skills do
not: **the video player, the async AI features, and provisioning.** Use
cloudinary-transformations for transformation URLs and cloudinary-docs for
anything outside this skill's scope.

## When to Use

- Adding video to a page or site, or improving how existing video is delivered
- Choosing between adaptive streaming (HLS or DASH) and progressive delivery
- Configuring the Cloudinary Video Player, its saved settings, or its profiles
- Generating transcripts, captions, chapters, titles, or descriptions for video
- Reviewing a video implementation against Cloudinary best practices
- Uploading video so a page can use it, including on a fresh claimable cloud

## Quick Start

### Default Best Practices: Apply These to Every Video Build

Unless the user has a specific reason not to, every video build you produce
should:

1. **Deliver video through the Cloudinary Video Player.** Fall back to a native
   `<video>` only when the player genuinely cannot be used, and say why.
2. **Pick one delivery branch per source, from the file itself.** Loops, short
   clips, and silent or music-only clips are progressive (`breakpoints: true`).
   Speech that a viewer presses play to watch, over about a minute, is
   adaptive (`sourceTypes: ['hls']`). See [B2](#b2-choose-the-optimization-strategy).
3. **Never hand-write delivery transformations for a player source.** No
   `f_auto`, `q_auto`, `sp_auto`, or widths in `transformation:`, and no
   `sourceTypes: ['mp4']`. The player already applies `f_auto:video`.
4. **Construct with `cloudinary.player()`, not `cloudinary.videoPlayer()`**, and
   queue seeks until its Promise resolves. See [B3](#b3-load-and-configure-the-player).
5. **Request `auto_transcription`, `auto_chaptering`, and `auto_video_details`
   on the upload call** (REST or a preset: the MCP and SDKs may not pass
   `auto_video_details`), and request add-on features in a separate call.
6. **Pre-generate derived videos when the first viewer matters**: eager
   transformations at upload (the explicit method for existing assets), or
   warmed URLs on a test cloud. Otherwise the first request streams with the
   wrong duration and no seeking.
7. **Name anything missing**, such as an absent add-on, and what enabling it
   takes, rather than silently dropping the feature.

## How to Use This

You are helping someone reach a goal for their video experience, not applying a
checklist. So:

- **Ask when an answer changes the build, or when you are unsure.** The
  delivery branch, which cloud the media lands on, whether an add-on exists, a
  source that turns out to be audio only: one question beats a wrong guess that
  costs a whole run. Say what you would pick and why, then let them redirect.
  Ask about facts, never about features (see *Start here*).
- **Recommend, don't enumerate, in conversation.** Where this skill gives
  options, pick the one that fits and say so in a line.
- **But build generously.** The restraint is in what you *say*, never in what
  you ship. Build the full experience (chapters, transcript, captions, AI
  poster, preview loops, structured data, responsive delivery): deleting a
  feature takes a minute, while never seeing it means they never knew to ask.
  Ship their site, not an exhibit about Cloudinary; see *Ship the site, not the
  demo scaffolding* in [references/build-patterns.md](references/build-patterns.md).
- **Say what is not there.** A missing add-on, a feature Cloudinary does not
  generate: name it plainly and move on.

The work has two phases: **Phase A** gets the assets onto Cloudinary (skip it
if they are already there), and **Phase B** builds the site.

## Start here: get the intent, then the logistics

Do not begin until you know what they are building. Each answer below changes
the work substantially, so **ask for any you were not given**: one question
costs a message, a wrong guess costs a run.

**1. What are you building, and what should the video do there?**

The one question the rest depends on. A product-page loop, a long-form library,
a course, a news page and a landing hero want different delivery, different
player features and different page shapes. Get this and most later choices
follow; skip it and you will build a competent version of the wrong thing.

**Do not interview them about features.** Do not ask whether they want
captions, chapters, transcripts or hover previews. Build them. Someone
describing what they want in chat should get the magic without being asked to
specify it, and should see everything Cloudinary can do for them before
deciding what to keep.

**2. Are the assets already on a Cloudinary cloud?**

Yes → **skip phase A entirely.** Go to phase B. Confirm the cloud name, how you
reach it (MCP or `CLOUDINARY_URL`; see the routing table in
[references/capabilities.md](references/capabilities.md)), and which public IDs
to build against. Do not re-upload assets that are already there.

No → ask where the source files are: local files, their own storage, or
another platform (see *If the media is on another platform* below). Never
substitute Cloudinary's `demo` cloud or other stock assets without asking.

**3. Where does it land: an existing cloud, or a new claimable one?**

| Destination | Consequences |
| --- | --- |
| Their **existing cloud** | No provisioning. No claim URL. Respect existing folders, naming and presets. Re-runs cost real quota and can overwrite live assets, so be idempotent, and never loop the catalogue to probe. |
| A **fresh claimable cloud** | Provision it (below). Expect no add-ons. Surface the claim URL at the end. Provision a new one per test run. |

Local files into an existing cloud is a legitimate combination: source and
destination are independent choices.

**Detect what you can, ask what you cannot.** Duration, whether there is a
video track and an audio track, resolution and which add-ons a cloud has are
all measurable:
`ffprobe` the source, probe one asset. Do not spend a question on something you
can check, and do not guess at something you cannot.

### If the media is on another platform

Moving a library off another video platform is out of scope for this skill.
Two rules still apply when the files come from one:

- **Upload the master, never what the website delivers.** A page serves
  transcoded renditions. Upload one and Cloudinary transcodes a transcode, so
  quality is permanently capped and every derived variant inherits the loss.
- **Prefer human-authored captions, chapters, and titles over regenerating
  them.** If the old platform has them, upload them alongside the video.

---

# Phase A: get the assets onto Cloudinary

## A1. Provision a cloud (fresh-cloud destinations only)

Run `npx @cloudinary/cloud --goal "<what you are building>" --model <your-model-id>`.
It needs no signup, writes `CLOUDINARY_URL` to `./.env`, and prints a **claim
URL**. The cloud expires 24 hours after provisioning unless claimed, so surface
the claim URL at the end. Leave `--ip` off when the user views media from
the machine you run on; if you run remotely (CI, a cloud agent), pass the
user's public IP. Provision a new cloud for every test run.

## A2. Upload, and request the AI features on the way in

Upload video with the free features on the same call: `auto_transcription`,
`auto_chaptering`, and `auto_video_details`. Request add-on features
(`translate`, `google_video_tagging`, `google_tagging`, `auto_tagging`) in a
separate call and treat failure as expected. Asking for an add-on the cloud
lacks fails the whole upload, or the whole transcription.

## A3. Wait for the async features

Transcripts, chapters, and generated titles return `pending` and finish later,
or fail. Poll each until `complete`. They need real speech: silent or
music-only video produces none of them.

## A4. Generate derived videos before anyone watches

The first request for a transformed video is the slow one. Ordinary
transformations return 200 but stream while they are generated, so the player
shows the wrong duration and cannot seek; async ones (`e_preview`, DASH, 2K/4K
`sp_auto`, very long videos) return 423 until built. For launches and long
videos, use eager transformations at upload (with explicit formats, since
`f_auto` does nothing in eager). On a demo or test cloud, warm every URL the
page uses and confirm it is complete by its headers, not its status.

Read [references/upload-and-prepare.md](references/upload-and-prepare.md) for
the commands, the upload rules that have bitten real runs, and how to verify
each step.

# Phase B: build the site

**Read [references/field-guide.md](references/field-guide.md) alongside this.**
It carries Cloudinary's own delivery best practices: the duration-based
delivery cheat sheet, the optimizations customers most often miss, the
`f_auto` transformation-usage spike to warn about, eager transformations,
mobile-app delivery, and the pre-launch validation checklist. Phase B below is
how to build; the field guide is what "built well" means.

## B1. Resolve what this cloud can actually do

Before writing page code, settle the capability set: one explicit flag map,
with a fallback per feature. This is what keeps a page honest on a cloud without
add-ons instead of rendering empty rails and dead caption buttons.

**On a fresh cloud**, assume no add-ons: translated subtitles and machine tags
will be absent every time, and that is correct rather than a regression.

**On a customer cloud**, probe: attempt the operation on **one** asset and read
the result. Never loop the catalogue: free tiers are small (Google Auto Tagging
50/month, Video Tagging 5/month) and on a customer cloud quota is their money.

The full matrix, the detection rules, and the **MCP vs `CLOUDINARY_URL` routing
table** are in [references/capabilities.md](references/capabilities.md). The
routing matters concretely: `ai_video_analysis` has no MCP tool and cannot be
signed without an API secret, so on an MCP-only build the audio description
track is unavailable, and generated titles need a preset that sets
`auto_video_details`. Everything else is reachable either way.

## B2. Choose the optimization strategy

An explicit decision, not a default. Retrofitting the other one means rewiring
the player.

**This is a fork, not a comparison.** Video Player Studio encodes it as a
segmented `Progressive | Adaptive` control: one source, one branch, and the
two sets of controls are disjoint. Reproduce that shape in code: decide the
branch first, then set only that branch's options.

| Studio branch | what it offers |
| --- | --- |
| **Progressive** | Format (Auto / WebM-VP9 / MP4-H.265 / MP4-H.264), Enable breakpoints (→ Max DPR), Auto HDR, Aspect Ratio (→ Resize Mode) |
| **Adaptive** | Format: **HLS or MPEG-DASH. Nothing else.** |

The Adaptive branch has no sizing controls because the streaming profile owns
them, the same rule the server enforces with *resize is only supported for
overlay*. **The real question is: is this decoration, or is this content
someone watches?** ABR only pays off when a viewer watches long enough for the
ladder to react to their network.

**`ffprobe` answers it, so read the source before choosing.** The signals are in
the file:

| Signal | Reading | Delivery |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Loops** | decoration by definition, seen in passing, never watched through | **progressive**, always |
| **No audio track** | background/ambient, and almost always short and autoplaying | **progressive** |
| **Audio but no speech** (music-only) | montage or mood piece, not something followed | **progressive** |
| **Portrait 9:16 or square** | social/short-form | **progressive** |
| **Under ~30s** | over before a ladder could switch; never ABR | **progressive** |
| **Speech, over ~1 min, viewer-pressed play** | content: a talk, explainer, interview, course | **ABR** |
| **No video track** (audio only) | `sp_auto`, posters and seek thumbnails return 400 | **progressive**, no `breakpoints`; see gotchas.md |

Each branch is one option. Nothing else:

| Approach | Set |
| --- | --- |
| **Progressive** | `breakpoints: true` |
| **ABR** | `sourceTypes: ['hls']` |

That is the whole configuration. No `sourceTypes` on the progressive branch, no
`breakpoints` on the adaptive one, and on neither a format, quality, width or
`maxDpr`. The player's default is already `f_auto:video`, `breakpoints` brings
DPR handling with it, and `sourceTypes:['hls']` emits `sp_auto` itself. Reach
for `maxDpr` only to deliberately cap DPR below the default 2.0.

Duration is the proxy, not the rule: a three-minute silent loop is still
progressive, because **behaviour wins over length**, except that under 30
seconds is always progressive. `ffprobe` shows whether there is audio (and so
whether transcripts, chapters, and titles can work, A3), not whether it is
speech; if you can't tell, ask.

**Neither is free to get wrong, and the costs are asymmetric.** ABR on a short
clip is a real and easy mistake: the ladder never switches, so you pay a
manifest round-trip and slower startup for nothing. Progressive on a long watch
fixes one rendition at load, so a network that degrades at minute eight stalls
with no recovery. That is worse, so a borderline video someone genuinely
watches goes ABR; a borderline video that autoplays stays progressive. "It's the
main player" is not a reason. Do not use `e_preview` to shorten an
already-short video either; loop the real file.

**Do not hand-write `f_auto`/`q_auto` for player-delivered video, and do not
force `sourceTypes:['mp4']`.** The player's default is already `f_auto:video`,
and `['mp4']` replaces it with a pinned extension. Hand-written
`c_limit,w_…/f_auto:video/q_auto` belongs to the native `<video>` fallback only.
The measured URLs are in [references/capabilities.md](references/capabilities.md).

If the player cannot be used at all, use a native `<video>` with
media-queried `<source>`s (see the same reference).

### Configure the player; do not hand-write its delivery transformation

The player composes the delivery transformation from its options. Anything you
write into `transformation:` that an option already covers lands in the *same*
component: redundant at best, and a 400 for `streaming_profile`.

```js
// WRONG: the profile shares a component with another directive:
// e_vignette:50,sp_auto → 400 "streaming_profile must be the only directive"
player.source(id, { sourceTypes: ['hls'],
  transformation: { streaming_profile: 'auto', effect: 'vignette:50' } });
// RIGHT: sourceTypes adds sp_auto itself
cloudinary.player(el, { sourceTypes: ['hls'] });   // → sp_auto/<id>.m3u8
```

`sp_auto` also accepts only a [limited set of other transformations](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/adaptive_bitrate_streaming.md?install_source=skillspack&referrer=video-skill#combining_transformations_with_automatic_streaming_profile_selection),
even in a separate component.

Hand-written transformations are for media no player delivers: posters, hover
previews, `e_preview` teasers, and the native `<video>` fallback. `breakpoints`
belongs to the progressive branch only. Set it under ABR and delivery returns
400 (*resize is only supported for overlay*).

`breakpoints` and `sourceTypes` work on the constructor and on each
`source()` call, and constructor values are inherited by every `source()`
call. So a page moving a viewer between a progressive and an ABR asset sets
both explicitly per call, for example
`player.source(id, { sourceTypes: ['hls'], breakpoints: false })`. Leaving the
inherited value in place carries the wrong option across.

Most pages want both, on **different** sources: ABR for the tour, progressive
for the loops. Full comparison table in
[references/capabilities.md](references/capabilities.md).

## B3. Load and configure the player

Install from npm and use the **ES import**. The package ships an `exports`
map with an `import` condition, bundles its own video.js, and loads the player
core behind a dynamic `import()`, so a bundler code-splits it for you:

```sh
npm install cloudinary-video-player
```

```js
import 'cloudinary-video-player/player.min.css';
import cloudinary from 'cloudinary-video-player';
```

For a single-file page with no build step, the UMD build off a CDN works the
same way and puts `cloudinary` on `window`:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/cloudinary-video-player@4.1.0/dist/player.min.css">
<script src="https://unpkg.com/cloudinary-video-player@4.1.0/dist/player.min.js"></script>
```

**Construct with `cloudinary.player()`, not `cloudinary.videoPlayer()`.**
`videoPlayer()` is the older synchronous constructor. `player()` is the
current one: it returns a **Promise**, and it resolves *saved configuration*
first. Pass `publicId` and it picks up the settings saved onto that asset in
Video Player Studio; pass `profile` for a stored profile instead.

```js
const player = await cloudinary.player('hero', {
  cloudName, publicId: 'my/video',   // asset's saved settings apply
  /* local options win over saved config */
});
```

Precedence is **construction options > profile > asset-saved > defaults**, so
repeating settings locally makes the saved config dead weight. Save the
presentation, pass only what is page-specific.

Settings are normally saved through Video Player Studio, but the **Video
Config API** writes the same thing without console access, which is useful on
a claimable cloud and makes a build reproducible. It is keyed by `asset_id`, not
public ID, and PUT replaces the whole document. Passing `publicId` with no
saved config is silent: HTTP 200 and an empty
`{"playerOptions":{},"sourceOptions":{}}`. The calls are in
[references/player.md](references/player.md).

Because construction is async, guard anything that seeks the player: a
transcript line clicked before it resolves must queue, not throw. The built-in
profiles and how to verify what applied are in the same reference.

Constructor options vs `source()` options: the split is about **how many
assets one player shows**. Constructor options configure the *player*;
`source()` options describe the *asset currently in it*.

**One player, one video:** set everything on the constructor and never call
`source()`. Pass `publicId` and you are done.

**One player, several videos** (a playlist, a rail, a gallery where clicking a
thumbnail changes the video): build the player **once** and call `source()` per
asset. Constructor options persist across the swap; the per-asset metadata
(`title`, `chapters`, `textTracks`) rides along with each `source()` call.
Building a new player per video is the common mistake: it costs a fresh
video.js instance each time and leaks the old ones unless you `dispose()`.

The one thing to watch when swapping is the delivery strategy above: set
`sourceTypes` and `breakpoints` explicitly on each `source()` call.

Player-only options go on the constructor and are ignored by `source()`.
Per-video options work on `source()`, and on the constructor they become
defaults every `source()` call inherits:

| Constructor only | `source()` (or constructor, as a default) |
| --- | --- |
| `cloudName`, `fluid`, `controls`, `showLogo`, `colors` | `sourceTypes`, `breakpoints`, `maxDpr`, `transformation` |
| `seekThumbnails`, `chaptersButton`, `aiHighlightsGraph` | `chapters`, `title`, `description`, `textTracks`, `posterOptions`, `interactionAreas` |

**`colors.text` must be a LIGHT colour.** Player chrome sits over dark video; a
dark text token makes the controls invisible.

Every option is in the
[Video Player API reference](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/video_player_api_reference.md?install_source=skillspack&referrer=video-skill);
the traps are in [references/player.md](references/player.md).

## B4. Wire the experience

The capabilities are only worth having if the page uses them. Patterns that
worked, with the reasoning, in
[references/build-patterns.md](references/build-patterns.md):

- **For a long source: open on an `e_preview` loop and build the player lazily**
  on first interaction: motion instead of a black frame, and no stream fetched
  until wanted. **For a short clip, just loop the real video muted** and build
  eagerly; there is no stream worth deferring and no teaser worth cutting.
- **Guard against the async constructor**: `cloudinary.player()` returns a
  Promise, so queue seeks that arrive before it resolves.
- **Compose `source()` from the flags** by conditional spread. Skip absent
  features; never stub them with a URL that 404s. Check the content too: a
  chapters VTT can return 200 with nothing but the `WEBVTT` header.
- **Bind playback both directions**: rail and transcript seek the player;
  `timeupdate` highlights the current segment. Render the rail before the player
  exists, since clicking it is what builds the player.
- **The transcript is JSON, not VTT**: hand it to the player for captions,
  fetch and render it yourself for on-page search with click-to-seek.
- **Emit JSON-LD** from the generated title, description and chapters.

## B4a. Generated, supplied, or hand-authored, in that order

Video Player Studio offers the same three-tier ladder on every piece of
content, and it is a good default for deciding where metadata comes from:

| panel | tier 1: generate | tier 2: supply | tier 3: author |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Chapters | Automatically generate chapters | Import a VTT file | Type `00:00` + name |
| Transcript | Generate | Upload | n/a |
| Poster | Suggested posters (AI frames) | Media Library / current frame | Upload |

Two things follow. First, **every generated artefact has a supply path beside
it**, so when a human-authored caption, chapter list or poster already exists
(for example, carried over from the platform the video came from), use it; the
ladder exists precisely so generation is not the only route. Second, the tiers
are per-asset, not per-site: generating chapters for a long talk and
hand-authoring three for a short explainer is normal.

## B5. Be straight about what Cloudinary does not generate

- **Chapter→product bindings.** Auto-chaptering finds the segments; which
  product a segment sells is your data. Check the source platform's cue points
  and custom fields first; often it is already there.
- **Hotspot positions.** `interactionAreas` takes coordinates you supply.
  Cloudinary does not track objects and hand you positions. The AI Video
  Analysis API (Beta) returns timestamped natural-language segments with no
  spatial coordinates or bounding boxes.
- **Video background removal, virtual try-on, shade matching.** These do not
  exist. Do not approximate them with something adjacent.

## Close out

- Which capabilities are on, which are off, **and why**: name the add-on and
  what enabling it needs.
- What was uploaded, and anything that had no Cloudinary equivalent.
- On a claimable cloud: **the claim URL**, and that it expires in 24 hours.

## How much of this is verified

Calibrate accordingly. The guidance is not uniformly tested:

- **Key Cloudinary behaviour is machine-verified.** A subset of the delivery,
  transformation and async-output claims is asserted against live Cloudinary by
  a test suite kept in the cloudinary-devs/skills repo (`sp_auto` rejecting a resize at every
  width, the transcript being JSON with word-level timings, the pinned player
  CDN URLs). If Cloudinary changes, those assertions fail rather than quietly
  misleading you.
- **Nothing here has been run end to end against an existing customer cloud.**
  The from-scratch path has a worked example behind it; that one does not.

Say which applies when you rely on one; don't present it all as equally sure.
